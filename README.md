# Forecasting-Using-Time-Series

Using Time Series models to predict future asing past values.
Used Models like :-
1.Auto Regressor
2. ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average)
3. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
4. SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

Also used Supervised Machine learning Algorithms with time series methods to predicts future.


ARMA Model
Red - Actual
Blue - Predicted
